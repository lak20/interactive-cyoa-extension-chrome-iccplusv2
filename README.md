This is a minimum effort fork of the original modified to work with both icc+ and icc+v2 available: https://github.com/wahaha303/ICCPlus

Browser extension for use with Interactive CYOAs.
With this you can give yourself as many points as you want, you can remove some other kinds of restrictions that CYOAs place upon you and allows you to "remove" random choices and chose which outcome you want.

The chrome extension can be found on the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/interactive-cyoa-assist-t/ndeibfhiocekjgafdadefcpiodkfcjbh

The firefox extension is currently not allowed on the Mozilla webstore because of the small target audience.
Firefox release has been created and signed by mozzila you can "install" it by clicking on firefox version on the right side of the screen and the under Assets click the file ending with .xpi.


The original author of this extension is free to do whatever they want with this fork also if they ask me to take it down I will.
