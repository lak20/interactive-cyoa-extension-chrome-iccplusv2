This is a minimum effort fork of the original modified to work with icc+v2 available: https://github.com/wahaha303/ICCPlus

Browser extension for use with Interactive CYOAs.
With this you can give yourself as many points as you want, and you can remove some other kinds of restrictions that CYOAs place upon you.

The chrome extension can be found on the Chrome Web Store: probably never, Im not paying 5$ for a developer account.
There is a not signed version of the extension in releases that you should be able to install
Chrome version requires you to turn on developer mode in the extensions tab first. Then you download the .crx file and Drag & Drop it onto chrome.

The firefox extension is currently not allowed on the Mozilla webstore because of the small target audience.
Firefox release has been created and signed by mozzila you can "install" it by clicking on firefox version on the right side of the screen and the under Assets click the file ending with .xpi.


The original author of this extension is free to do whatever they want with this fork also if they ask me to take it down I will.
