Browser extension for use with Interactive CYOAs.
With this you can give yourself as many points as you want, and you can remove some other kinds of restrictions that CYOAs place upon you.

The chrome extension can be found on the Chrome Web Store: once post it there probably

The firefox extension is currently not allowed on the Mozilla webstore because of the small target audience.
I will create a firefox release here soon.
